      Use the [`accept()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/ServerSocket.html#accept--) method to get the client connection:

      ```kotlin
      // The return value is the client's connection (a Socket)
      val client = serverSocket.accept()
      ```

      The `accept()` method waits for a client to connect and then returns a `Socket` for that connection.

      Use the [`write()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/OutputStream.html#write-byte:A-) method on the client's output stream:

      ```kotlin
      // 'client' is the Socket returned by accept()
      val out = client.getOutputStream()
      out.write("+PONG\r\n".toByteArray())
      ```

      - The `toByteArray()` call converts the string to a byte array.
      - `+PONG\r\n` is the string "PONG" encoded as a [RESP simple string](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/reference/protocol-spec/#simple-strings).
