      Use `childChannelInitializer(...)` to access the client's TCP connection:
      
      ```swift
      .childChannelInitializer { channel in
        // 'channel' is the client's TCP connection
        return channel.eventLoop.makeSucceededFuture(())
      }
      ```
      
      The `childChannelInitializer(...)` method registers a closure for each accepted connection, and then passes the client's `Channel` into it.

    body_markdown: |-
      Use `writeAndFlush()` to send the PONG response:
      
      ```swift
      // inside .childChannelInitializer { channel in ... }
      var buffer = channel.allocator.buffer(string: "+PONG\r\n")
      channel.writeAndFlush(buffer, promise: nil)
      ```
      
      - `channel.allocator.buffer(string:)` creates a `ByteBuffer` containing the string's UTF-8 bytes.
      - `+PONG\r\n` is the string "PONG" encoded as a [RESP simple string](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/reference/protocol-spec/#simple-strings).
