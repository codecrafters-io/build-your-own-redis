      Welcome to the Build your own Redis challenge! Now that you've got your repository set up, it's time to start building your Redis server.

      In this stage, you'll implement a TCP server that listens on port 6379.

      [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) is the underlying protocol used by protocols like HTTP, SSH and others
      you're probably familiar with. Redis clients & servers use TCP to communicate with each other.

      Don't worry if you're unfamiliar with the TCP protocol, or what Redis clients & servers are. You'll learn more about this in the
      next stages.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      $ ./spawn_redis_server.sh
      ```

      It'll then try to connect to your TCP server on port 6379. If the connection succeeds, you'll pass this stage.

      ### Notes

      - 6379 is the default port that Redis uses.
      - If you already have a Redis server running on your machine and listening on port 6379, you'll see a "port already in use" error when running your code. Try stopping the existing Redis server and running your code again.

    description_md: |-
      🎉 You now have a TCP server running on port 6379! It doesn't do anything useful yet though, let's change that.

      In this stage, you'll implement support for the [PING](https://redis.io/commands/ping) command.

      Redis clients communicate with Redis servers by sending "[commands](https://redis.io/commands/)". For each command, a Redis server sends a response back to the client.
      Commands and responses are both encoded using the [Redis protocol](https://redis.io/topics/protocol) (we'll learn more about this in later stages).

      [PING](https://redis.io/commands/ping/) is one of the simplest Redis commands. It's used to check whether a Redis server is healthy.

      The response for the `PING` command is `+PONG\r\n`. This is the string "PONG" encoded using the [Redis protocol](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/).

      In this stage, we'll cut corners by ignoring client input and hardcoding `+PONG\r\n` as a response. We'll learn to parse client input in later stages.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      $ ./spawn_redis_server.sh
      ```

      It'll then send a `PING` command to your server and expect a `+PONG\r\n` response.

      ```bash
      $ redis-cli ping
      ```

      Your server should respond with `+PONG\r\n`, which is "PONG" encoded as a [RESP simple string](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/#resp-simple-strings).

      ### Notes

      - You can ignore the data that the tester sends you for this stage. We'll get to parsing
      client input in later stages. For now, you can just hardcode `+PONG\r\n` as the response.
      - You can also ignore handling multiple clients and handling multiple PING commands in the stage, we'll get to that in later stages.
      - The exact bytes your program will receive won't be just `ping`, you'll receive something like this: `*1\r\n$4\r\nping\r\n`,
      which is the Redis protocol encoding of the `PING` command. We'll learn more about this in later stages.

      In most languages, you'd need to either use threads or implement an
      [Event Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop) to do this. In JavaScript however, since [the concurrency
      model itself is based on an event loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop), most
      standard library functions are designed to support this kind of concurrent behaviour out of the box. **It is very

  # Persistence

    name: "RDB file config"
    difficulty: easy
    description_md: |
      Redis uses `.rdb` files for persistence. In this stage, you'll add support for reading the config values related to where RDB files are stored.

      There are two config values that determine where RDB files are stored:

      - `dir`: The directory where RDB files are stored
      - `dbfilename`: The name of the RDB file

      These values will be passed into your program like this:

      ```
      ./spawn_redis_server.sh --dir /tmp/redis-files --dbfilename dump.rdb
      ```

      To verify whether your program is reading config values correctly, the tester will send you two commands:

      ```bash
      redis-cli CONFIG GET dir
      redis-cli CONFIG GET dbfilename
      ```

      The response to `CONFIG GET <key>` should be a RESP array with two elements: the key and the value.

      For example, let's say the `dir` value is `/tmp/redis-files`. The expected response will be:

      ```
      *2\r\n$3\r\ndir\r\n$16\r\n/tmp/redis-files\r\n
      ```

      - `*2\r\n` indicates that the array has two elements
      - `$3\r\ndir\r\n` indicates that the first element is a bulk string with the value `dir`
      - `$16\r\n/tmp/redis-files\r\n` indicates that the second element is a bulk string with the value `/tmp/redis-files`

      **Note**: If your repository was created before 5th Oct 2023, it's possible that your `./spawn_redis_server.sh` script
      might not be passing arguments on to your program. You'll need to edit `./spawn_redis_server.sh` to fix this, check
      [this PR](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-redis/pull/89/files) for details.

    description_md: |
      In this stage, you'll add support for reading a key from an RDB file.

      To keep things simple, we'll start out by supporting RDB files that contain a single key.

      Jan-Erik Rediger (author of [rdb-rs](https://rdb.fnordig.de/)) has a great [write-up](https://rdb.fnordig.de/file_format.html)
      that explains the RDB file format in detail. We recommend using it as a reference when working on this stage.

      The tester will create an RDB file with a single key and execute your program like this:

      ```
      ./spawn_redis_server.sh --dir <dir> --dbfilename <filename>
      ```

      It'll then send a `keys *` command to your server.

      ```bash
      $ redis-cli keys "*"
      ```

      The response to `keys *` should be a RESP array with one element: the key.

      For example, let's say the RDB file contains a key called `foo`. The expected response will be:

      ```
      *1\r\n$3\r\nfoo\r\n
      ```

      - `*1\r\n` indicates that the array has one element
      - `$3\r\nfoo\r\n` indicates that the first element is a bulk string with the value `foo`

      **Note**: Remember, in this stage you only need to support RDB files that contain a single key, and you can ignore the value of the key. We'll
      get to handling multiple keys and reading values in later stages.

      **Note**: The `.rdb` file provided via `--dir`/`--dbfilename` might not exist. If the file doesn't exist, your program must treat it as if the database
      is currently empty.

      In this stage, you'll add support for reading the value corresponding to a key from an RDB file.

      Just like with the previous stage, we'll stick to supporting RDB files that contain a single key for now.

      The tester will create an RDB file with a single key and execute your program like this:

      ```
      ./spawn_redis_server.sh --dir <dir> --dbfilename <filename>
      ```

      It'll then send a `get <key>` command to your server.

      ```bash
      $ redis-cli get "foo"
      ```

      The response to `get <key>` should be a RESP bulk string with the value of the key.

      For example, let's say the RDB file contains a key called `foo` with the value `bar`. The expected response will be `$3\r\nbar\r\n`.

      Strings can be encoded in three different ways in the RDB file format:

      - Length-prefixed strings
      - Integers as strings
      - Compressed strings

      In this stage, you only need to support length-prefixed strings. We won't cover the other two types in this challenge.

      We recommend using [this blog post](https://rdb.fnordig.de/file_format.html) as a reference when working on this stage.

      ```bash
      $ redis-cli keys "*"
      ```

      The response to `keys *` should be a RESP array with the keys as elements.

      For example, let's say the RDB file contains two keys: `foo` and `bar`. The expected response will be:

      ```
      *2\r\n$3\r\nfoo\r\n$3\r\nbar\r\n
      ```

      - `*2\r\n` indicates that the array has two elements
      - `$3\r\nfoo\r\n` indicates that the first element is a bulk string with the value `foo`
