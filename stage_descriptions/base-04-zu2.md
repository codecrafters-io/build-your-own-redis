In this stage, you'll add support for multiple concurrent clients.

### Handling Multiple Clients

In addition to handling multiple commands from the same client, Redis servers can also handle multiple clients at once.

In most languages, you'd need to either use threads or implement an
[Event Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop) to do this. In JavaScript, however, since [the concurrency
model itself is based on an event loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop), most
standard library functions are designed to support this kind of concurrent behaviour out of the box. **It is very
likely that the code you had for the previous stage will pass this stage without any changes!**

To implement this, you'll need to either use threads or, if you're feeling adventurous, an [Event Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop) (like the official Redis implementation does).

### Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```bash
$ ./your_program.sh
```

It'll then send two `PING` commands concurrently using two different connections:

```bash
# These two will be sent concurrently so that we can test your server's ability to handle concurrent clients.
$ redis-cli PING
$ redis-cli PING
```
The tester will expect to receive two separate `+PONG\r\n` responses.

### Notes

- Since the tester client _only_ sends the `PING` command at the moment, it's okay to
  ignore what the client sends and hardcode a response. We'll get to parsing
  client input in later stages.
